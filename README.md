# Trajectory_Optimization_AutonomousCar
Multi-stage Trajectory Optimization for parking maneuver of an Autonomous vehicle

* Deployed two-stage optimization framework with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) in MATLAB. 
* PSO output served as the initial guess to SQP
* Generated simulation results for different scenarios. Improved convergence ability and computational cost by 67.6%
